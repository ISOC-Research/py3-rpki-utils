 * ASN.1 templates.  Not sure that ASN1_EXP_OPT() is the right macro
 * for these defaulted "version" fields, but it's what the examples
 * for this construction use.  So far it has not mattered, as code
 * using these definitions have only decoded ROAs, never encoded
 * them.  We'll see if that breaks with encoding.
 *
 * Putting this section under conditional compilation is a hack to
 * keep Doxygen's parser from becoming hopelessly confused by the
 * weird OpenSSL ASN.1 macros.  Someday perhaps I'll have time to
 * track down the problem in Doxygen's parser, but this works for now.

C header files common to RPKI code.  For now, most of this is ASN.1
definitions in OpenSSL's strange template language.  May add utility
routines later.

Due to complexities of the build environment in which some of this is
used, we may end up keeping all the shared C code in .h files rather
than attempting to build a library that all the programs can use.
Python extension modules in particular have their own peculiar linkage
requirements, and while we could no doubt jump thorugh hoops to get
all of this right on every platform, it's much simpler to handle code
reuse via the C preprocssor.  Hey, it worked for MIDAS on ITS.

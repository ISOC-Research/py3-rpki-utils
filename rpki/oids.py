OID database.

This used to be fairly complicated, with multiple representations and
a collection of conversion functions, but now it is very simple:

- We represent OIDs as Python strings, holding the dotted-decimal
  form of an OID.  Nothing but decimal digits and "." is legal.
  This is compatible with the format that rpki.POW uses.

- We define symbols in this module whose values are OIDs.

That's pretty much it.  There's a bit of code at the end which checks
the syntax of the defined strings and provides a pretty-print function
for the rare occasion when we need to print an OID, but other than
that this is just a collection of symbolic names for text strings.
